A few tips to prepare for the Career Fair:

Apply for jobs you are interested in online before talking to recruiters. This gets you one step ahead of the game and allows you to have more conversation with recruiters.

Attend Receptions! The more times you can talk to recruiters the better. Let the recruiter remember you!

Pick up your Career Fair Resource Guide for more tips on preparing for the fair! Visit the SWE or TBP tables during Northfest, stop by the SWE office in the Bullpen in EECS, look for us in the Duderstadt
Connector during the week of September 18th, or click here for a digital copy.

A few more tips the days of Career Fair:

Talk to companies you are not extremely interested in first to shake your nerves.

BE CALM. Youâ€™ve done your research, and are fully prepared to talk to any recruiter that comes your way. Let that personality shine!

BE PATIENT. Waiting in line can be tiring and boring. Make the most of that time-go over your elevator pitch or do some more company research in line.
